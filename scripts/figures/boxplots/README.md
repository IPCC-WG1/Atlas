# Code for reproducibility of the ATLAS boxplots and scatterplots of model projections

`boxplots_TandP.R` is the star script of the ATLAS!!

It is flexible and easy to use. There is no special requirements for executing the script (only an R environment with a few packages), as it uses R functions and data stored in this repository. 

The R function used is computeFigures (available at [aggregated-datsets/scripts](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/tree/mai-devel/aggregated-datasets/scripts)) and the data used are the regional means available at [aggregated-datsets/data](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/tree/mai-devel/aggregated-datasets/data)
