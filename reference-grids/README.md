### Reference Grids

The 0.5 degree, 1 degree and 2 degree reference grids are land/sea fractions that are used as the common spatial grid to which the data is interpolated and also as the masks that are applied for subsequent land sea separated analysis. 

Folder *scripts* contains the R script used to create these grids and folder *notebooks* contains a jupyter notebook illustrating a simple example of their use in R.
