### Reference Grids

The Atlas project considers common 2 deg, 1 deg and 0.5 deg spatial grids (with land/sea fraction values) to represent CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX data, respectively. 

Folder *scripts* contains the R script used to create these grids and folder *notebooks* contains a jupyter notebook illustrating a simple example of their use in R.
