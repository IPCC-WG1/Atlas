## Notebooks

(Jupyter) notebooks describe the process to reproduce key figures describing further options, thus promoting reusability of the results. These notebooks are provided as guidance for practitioners, more user friendly than the code provided in the scripts folder. 

Note that notebooks and scripts are included also in the thematic folders (e.g. warming-levels) to support reproducibility of all intermediate technical aspects.
