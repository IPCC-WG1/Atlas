## Notebooks

(Jupyter) notebooks describe the process followed to generate key figures (step by step) and includes comments and hints to extend the analysis, thus promoting reusability of the results. These notebooks are provided as guidance for practitioners, more user friendly than the code provided in the scripts folder. 

Note that notebooks and scripts are included also in the thematic folders (e.g. warming-levels) to support reproducibility of all intermediate technical aspects.
