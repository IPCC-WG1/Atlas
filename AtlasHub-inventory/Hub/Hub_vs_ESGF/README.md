# Comprehensive inventory of CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX Datasets

The inventories of model simulations, experiments and scenarios used in the ATLAS that are available through the latest releases of climate4R are included here. These files show comprehensive inventories that allow to compare and monitor the progress of data availability with reference to which is available in ESGF (shown in [ESGF-inventory](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/tree/devel/ESGF-inventory)).


These inventories show three possible cases:
* 1 or green: Available in ESGF & available in the Hub 
* 0 or red: Available in ESGF & Not available in the Hub yet.
* NA or white : Not available in ESGF (and therefore not in the Hub either)
