# Inventory of CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX Datasets

The inventories of model simulations used in the ATLAS for the different experiments and scenarios are included here, 
indicating the availability of the different variables analyzed (so far temperatures and precipitation) as well as 
auxiliary fixed fields, such as the land/sea mask (sftlf). For CMIP6 and CORDEX two different temporal 
frquencies are used (daily and monthly); the latter are referred to by indicating 'mon' in the file name 
(e.g. CMIP6Amon vs CMIP6).
