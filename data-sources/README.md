# Data sources for CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX datasets used

An inventory of the data sources of the model simulations used for the different experiments and scenarios is included here, indicating the availability of the different variables as well as auxiliary fixed fields, such as the land/sea mask (sftlf). The following documents provide a full overview of the simulations available: 

 * [CMIP5_simulations_ATLAS.xlxs](CMIP5_simulations_ATLAS.xlxs)
 * [CMIP6_simulations_ATLAS.xlxs](CMIP6_simulations_ATLAS.xlxs)
 * [CORDEX_simulations_ATLAS.xlxs](CORDEX_simulations_ATLAS.xlxs)

Full metadata is organized as machine-readable tables in the different CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX folders. This includes the ESGF version used for each model and variable so the data is fully traceable. CMIP6 includes different temporal frequencies (day/mon) and realms (atmos, land, ocean, seaIce). The data consolidated here is a subset of the data available at ESGF for the relevant experiments used.
README files in the different folders provide handle and/or ESGF search links pointing to the specific datasets used.

[Dataset_DOIs.html](https://raw.githack.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/devel/data-sources/Dataset_DOIs.html) contains a searchable table with the DOIs for all datasets that provide them. Dataset DOIs provide provenance information at the dataset level. This table feeds from the [dataset_table.csv](https://github.com/metaclip/metaclipcc/blob/master/inst/dataset_table.csv) in [metaclipcc](https://github.com/metaclip/metaclipcc).

> Note:
> 
> This folder traces the exact version of the datasets used in the Atlas. Newer versions of these data may exist in the future for different reasons. Users should visit the ES-DOC Dataset Errata website (https://errata.es-doc.org) to check the availability of newer versions or data retractions in the datasets stored in this repository.
