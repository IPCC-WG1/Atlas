# Warming levels for the IPCC Interactive Atlas

Time periods (20-years) for which +1.5, +2, +3 and +4 degree Global Warming Levels (GWL) are reached with respect to pre-industrial 1850-1900 mean value. Values correspond to the central year (n) of the 20-year window (the GWL period is thus calculated as [n-9, n+10]). Empty table cells indicate that the GWL was not reached before (the central year) 2100. '9999' correspond to models with no available experiment results.

The use of a 20-year moving window is to be consistent with the four time slices used in AR6: the modern period (1995-2014), the near-term (2021-2040), mid-term (2041-2060) and long-term (2081-2100). 

CMIP5 and CMIP6 results are computed using the script in the R folder and results are included in CMIP5/CMIP6_Atlas_WarmingLevels.csv files. The models included used in the Interactive Atlas, as shown in
