### Regionally aggregated datasets

This repository includes regionally aggregated datasets (over the IPCC reference regions) for a number of observational and climate change projection sources, as detailed below including their particular terms of use.

The **[W5E5](https://doi.org/10.5880/pik.2019.023) dataset** (WFDE5 over land merged with ERA5 over the ocean) is distributed under the **[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)** license.

The **[CMIP5](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/) aggregated dataset** in this repository is distributed under the **[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)** under the unrestricted version of the [CMIP5 terms of use](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/terms-of-use.html).

The **[CORDEX](https://cordex.org) aggregated dataset** in this repository is distributed under the **[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)** under the unrestricted version of the [CORDEX terms of use](http://is-enes-data.github.io/cordex_terms_of_use.pdf).

The **[CMIP6](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/) aggregated dataset** in this repository is distributed under the **[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)** under the [CMIP6 terms of use](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/TermsOfUse/TermsOfUse6-2.html). 

> We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme, which, through its Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM), the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), coordinated and promoted the production of the global (CMIP5 and CMIP6) and regional (CORDEX-CMIP5) climate projection datasets. We thank the climate modelling groups for producing and making available their model output, the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) for archiving the data and providing access, and the multiple funding agencies who support this work.

> We acknowledge the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research for producing and making available the WFDE5 and the W5E5 datasets.
