# Inventory of CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX Datasets used in the ATLAS

The inventories of model simulations used in the ATLAS for the different experiments and scenarios are included here, indicating the availability of the different variables analyzed as well as auxiliary fixed fields, such as the land/sea mask (sftlf). For CMIP6 two different temporal frequencies are used (daily and monthly, indicated by 'day' and 'mon' in the files). Oceanic variables are listed using the standard realm names (e.g. 'omon' for oceanic monthly). CORDEX information is included only for the North America CORDEX domain (CORDEX-NAM) in this version but will be soon extended to other domains.

These inventories are organized as (machine readable) tables, indicating the ESGF version used for each model and variable, so the data is fully traceable. 

The data consolidated in the ATLAS is a subset of the data available at ESGF for the relevant experiments used in the ATLAS and is updated periodically. A parallel inventory of ESGF availability is maintained in the [ESGF-inventory](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/tree/devel/ESGF-inventory) folder in order to check the available updates. The differences between both repositories are displayed at [Hub/Hub_vs_ESGF/](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/tree/devel/ATLAS-inventory/Hub/Hub_vs_ESGF).
