# Inventory of ESGF Datasets

This folder provides inventories of model simulations available at the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). This is maintained to keep track of the information available in CMIP initiatives in order to plan downloading and consolidation in the ATLAS dataset.

Note that `esgf-utils` is a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) that provides scripts for generating inventories. You need to explicitly init it:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
