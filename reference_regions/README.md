# AR6-WGI Reference regions and CMIP6 averaged results

The new references resgions are provided as polygons (csv and shapefile, *AR6-WGI_refereceRegions.zip*). Moreover, the R and Python notebooks illustrating the use of these regions with worked out examples are also provided.

Spatially averaged results of CMIP6 models have been computed for the different reference regions and are available at the *regional_means* folder (see [IPCC-Altas Hub inventory](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/IPCC-Atlas/tree/devel/AtlasHub-inventory), version 20191211).
