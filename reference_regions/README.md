# AR6-WGI Reference regions and CMIP6 averaged results

The new AR6-WGI references resgions are provided as polygons (csv and shapefile, *AR6-WGI_refereceRegions.zip*) and a R notebook.

Spatially averaged results of CMIP6 models have been computed for the different reference regions and are available at the *regional_means* folder (see [IPCC-Altas Hub inventory](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/IPCC-Atlas/tree/devel/AtlasHub-inventory), version 20191211).
