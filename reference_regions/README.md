### Updated AR5 Reference Regions and CMIP6 averaged results

The new references regions are provided as polygons in different formats (csv with coordinates, R data, and shapefile, *CMIP6_refereceRegions*) together with R and Python notebooks illustrating the use of these regions with worked out examples.

Spatially averaged results of CMIP6 models have been computed for the different reference regions and are available at the *regional_means* folder (see [IPCC-Altas Hub inventory](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/IPCC-Atlas/tree/devel/AtlasHub-inventory), version 20191211).
