## CMIP5, CMIP6 AND CORDEX spatial averages over the reference regions

Spatially aggregated monthly results over the reference regions for CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX ATLAS datasets (a single run per model) separately for land, sea, and land-sea gridboxes.

Additionally, results for all CMIP6 model runs (*CMIP6Amon_Hub* version 20191028 in 'ATLAS-inventory/Hub') are also available at the following links:

Note that the aggregated results for CORDEX datasets are calculated only in those AR6 regions whose areas overlap by more than 80% with each CORDEX domain. File *data/CORDEX/CORDEXDomainsVSreferenceRegions.csv* contains the percentage of area overlapped between each CORDEX domain and the AR6 regions.  Regular geographic grids for every CORDEX domain are obtained from Table 2 available in the CORDEX specification archive (https://is-enes-data.github.io/cordex_archive_specifications.pdf)

NOTE!: Regional averages are weighted by the cosine of latitude.
