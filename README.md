# IPCC-Atlas
Code for reproducing some of the products of the AR6 WGI Interactive Atlas (First Order Draft)

The accessibility and reproducibility of scientific results is a major concern in all scientific disciplines. During the design and development of the Interactive Atlas, special attention has been paid to these problems in order to ensure the transparency of the products feeding the Interactive Atlas (which will be all publicly available). Accessibility will be established in collaboration with the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (based on curated IPCC-DDC datasets). The Atlas products are generated using free software community tools, in particular [R](https://www.r-project.org) building on the [climate4R framework](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R) for data post-processing (regridding, aggregation, bias adjustment, etc.) and evaluation and quality control (when applicable). Provenance metadata information will be provided for all products using the METACLIP RDF-based framework (in particular the [metaclipR](https://github.com/metaclip/metaclipR) package fro the climate4R framework).

This repository is a start for the reproducibility activities of the IPCC WGI Atlas, including a notebook with commented code for reproducing the figures of regional synthesis.
