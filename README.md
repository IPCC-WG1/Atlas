## The Climate Change ATLAS: Datasets, code and virtual workspace

The Climate Change ATLAS is an initiative to develop **ready-to-use code and datasets** for regional analysis of observed and model projected (e.g. CMIP6 and CORDEX) climate change information using both time-slices (e.g. 2081-2100) and warming levels (e.g. +1.5º). A **new set of sub-continental reference regions** is provided as the basis for regional synthesis (building on IPCC AR5 reference regions) and monthly spatially aggregated datasets are produced to facilitate the development of regional climate change proudcts. 

The **accessibility and reproducibility** of results has been a major concern during the development of the Climate Change ATLAS, in order to ensure the transparency of the products (which are all publicly available). The Atlas products are generated using **free software community tools**, in particular [R](https://www.r-project.org) building on the [**climate4R** framework](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R) for data post-processing (data access, regridding, aggregation, bias adjustment, etc.) and evaluation and quality control (when applicable). **Provenance/ metadata** is generated using the [**METACLIP**](http://www.metaclip.org) RDF-based framework (building on the [metaclipR](https://github.com/metaclip/metaclipR) package for the climate4R framework).

### New Reference Regions 
A new set of reference regions is produced building on the popular [AR5 IPCC reference regions](http://www.ipcc-data.org/guidelines/pages/ar5_regions.html) developed for reporting sub-continental CMIP5 (with typical resolution of 2º) projections over a reduced number of regions. The increased reasolution (typically 1º in CMIP6) allows to increase the number of regions for a better climatic representatio (this results in **43 land and 12 open ocean reference regions**). The coordinates (csv and shapefiles) of the regions and related datasets are available at the *reference_regions* directory.

### Aggregated CMIP6 datasets
The IPCC reference regions have been used as the basis to generate popular spatially aggregated datasets, such as the [IPCC AR5 seasonal mean temperature and precipitation in IPCC regions for CMIP5](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/9d0f61dc7a1b4017b22d88f9d38ab398). Here we provide a updated version of this dataset using CMIP6 projections (interpolated to a common 1º resolution, see [referece_masks](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/tree/master/reference_masks)) for the new regions. Monthly mean values are stored for the historical (1850-2014) and RCP2.6/SSP1, RCP4.5/SSP2 and RCP8.5/SSP5 scenarios (2015-2100). This will later extended to CMIP5 and CORDEX datasets. An inventory of the currently available models and runs is available at the [Atlas-Hub inventory](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/tree/master/AtlasHub-inventory).

Besides the analysis of time-slices (e.g. near-, mid- and long-term, 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2081-2100, respectively), we also provide information to work with [Global Warming Levels (+1.5º, +2º, +3º, +4º)](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/tree/master/GWL). 

### Virtual Workspace: The Atlas Hub
The Atlas Hub is a cloud facility providing virtual workspace for the Climate Change Atlas code and data (with preinstalled software and accesible data). The Atlas Hub is based on **Jupyter** to create and run notebooks on a remote machine where all the software is pre-installed (instructions available in the *Atlas_hub_instructions.pdf* document). The Atlas Hub builds on the R **climate4R** package, allowing for transparent climate data access, collocation, post-processing (including bias correction) and visualization. Instructions to start working with the Hub are available at the document [Atlas_hub_instructions.pdf](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/blob/master/man/Atlas_Hub_instructions.pdf) in the *man* folder on this repository.

### **Important**: This initiative contributes to the development of the IPCC AR6 Atlas, but this is not an official IPCC site. This repository is fully managed by the [Santander Met Group](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup) and it is only intended to keep track of internal research activities.
