## Reference Regions

Different sets of climatic reference regions have been proposed for the regional synthesis of historical trends and future climate change projections, and have been subsequently used in the different Assessment Reports of the IPCC WGI (we refer to these sets as **IPCC-WGI reference regions**). The Giorgi reference regions (originally 23 squared regions proposed in [Giorgi and Francisco, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00013733), denoted here as **version 1**) were used in the third (AR3) and fourth (AR4) IPCC Assessment reports. These regions were later modified using more flexible polygons in the IPCC SREX special report ([Seneviratne et al., 2012](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/SREX-Chap3_FINAL-1.pdf), **version 2**) and then slightly modified and extended to 33 regions (by including island states, the Arctic and Antarctica) for the fifth Assessment Report (AR5, [van Oldenborgh et al., 2013](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/atlas-of-global-and-regional-climate-projections), **version 3**). 

This repository includes technical and supplementary information for a recent update of these regions presented in https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2019-258 (referred to as **IPCC-WGI reference regions (version 4)**). The updated reference regions are provided as polygons in different formats (csv with coordinates, R data, and shapefile) together with R and Python notebooks illustrating the use of these regions with worked out examples.

The csv file contains the corner coordinates defining each region in [EPSG:4326](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/) and is used to build the spatial objects (the R data file and the shapefile), which contain coordinate information at a 0.44ยบ resolution. This additional information is created via linear interpolation, while keeping the original vertices defined in the csv.

Spatially averaged results of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models (see [Altas Hub inventory](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/IPCC-Atlas/tree/devel/AtlasHub-inventory), version 20191211) have been computed for the different reference regions and are available at the [*aggregated-datasets*](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/tree/devel/aggregated-datasets) folder.

**NOTE!**: Region acronyms followed by the `*` suffix in the csv file define the part of the polygon of the same name that extends beyond the 180ยบ meridian (i.e. RAR, NPO, EPO and SPO). This necessary distinction in the csv disappears in the spatial objects (the R data object and the shapefile), as the regions separated by the 180ยบ meridian are merged and considered as a single polygon.
