# Errata and problem reporting

The *errata* of the Atlas covers both the content (products, such as plots and data) and the application/platform of the [Interactive Atlas](http://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch), as well as this GitHub repository supporting reproducibility and reusability. The existing products are frozen and the issues reported are documented in the [errata list](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues?q=label%3Aerrata), detailing problems found in the final products. Other technical problems not affecting the products could be [fixed and documented](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues?q=label%3Aproblem). 

To report an issue with the final products (plots and data), please:
 1. Make sure that the problem has not been reported yet. Check [here](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues?q=label%3Aerrata).
 2. Fill in [this errata template](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues/new?labels=errata&template=problem-report.md).

To report any other technical issue regarding e.g. Interactive Atlas application malfunctioning, typos, make suggestions, etc., please:
 1. Make sure that the topic has not been covered yet. Check [here](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues?q=label%3Aproblem).
 2. Fill in [this issue template](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues/new?labels=problem&template=problem-report.md).

This repository supporting AR6 WGI is frozen, and does not accept any further contribution. Development continues in the [SantanderMetGroup ATLAS repository](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS), where we welcome your input (note that this is no longer an official IPCC product/activity):

 - Discussing the current state of the repository
 - Submitting a fix
 - Providing notebooks/scripts in alternative programming languages
 - Proposing new notebooks/scripts exploiting the data 
 -
