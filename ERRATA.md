# Errata and problem reporting

This GitHub IPCC-WG1 Atlas repository implements FAIR principles for the products of the IPCC [Interactive Atlas](http://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch).   Problem reporting is implemented via the GitHub issue tracking system and covers both the GitHub repository and the Interactive Atlas, with a special tag ("IA") indicating the issues corresponding to the latter. 

To report any problem, technical issue, or suggestion regarding the **Interactive Atlas** please:
 1. Make sure that the issue has not been covered yet. Check [here](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues?q=label%3AIA).
 2. Fill in [this issue template](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues/new?labels=IA&template=interactive-atlas-report.md).
The issues received will be analyzed by the Atlas support team and classified as either *errata, problem, suggestion, question* including relevant comments and actions taken (if any). The category *errata* will be assigned only to problems affecting the Interactive Atlas products and will be communicated by the Atlas support team to IPCC following the official errata reporting procedure (see https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#errata).
