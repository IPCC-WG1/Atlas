# Errata and problem reporting

Problem reporting is implemented via the GitHub issue tracking system and covers both this GitHub repository and the [Interactive Atlas](http://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch), with a special tag ("IA") indicating the issues corresponding to the latter. All issues reported are managed by Atlas support team and classified and labeled as either *errata, problem, suggestion, question* including relevant comments and actions taken (if any). The label *errata* is assigned only to problems affecting the published IPCC reports (e.g. Atlas figures and Interactive Atlas maps and graphics) that will also be reported to IPCC following the official [IPCC errata reporting procedure](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#errata). 

To report any problem, technical issue, or suggestion regarding the **Interactive Atlas** please:
 1. Make sure that the issue has not been covered yet. Check [here](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues?q=label%3AIA).
 2. Fill in [this issue template](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues/new?labels=IA&template=interactive-atlas-report.md).

To report an issue with this **Atlas GitHub repository** please:
 1. Make sure that the issue has not been covered yet. Check [here](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues?q=-label%3AIA+-label%3Areview).
 2. Open a [blank issue](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues/new).

**Disclaimer:** Users interested in reporting officially an errata should follow directly the official [IPCC errata reporting procedure](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#errata).
