# Errata and problem reporting

Problem reporting is done through the GitHub issue tracking system and covers both this GitHub repository and the [Interactive Atlas](http://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch), with a special tag ("IA") indicating the issues corresponding to the latter. All reported issues are managed by the Atlas support team and classified and labeled as *errata, problem, suggestion, question*, including relevant comments and actions taken (if any). The *errata* label is assigned only to issues found to affect the published IPCC report (e.g. Atlas figures and Interactive Atlas maps and graphics) which will also be reported by the team to the IPCC following the official [IPCC errata notification procedure](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#errata). 

To report any problem, technical issue, or suggestion regarding the **Interactive Atlas** please:
 1. Make sure that the issue has not been covered yet. Check [here](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues?q=label%3AIA).
 2. Fill in [this issue template](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues/new?labels=IA&template=interactive-atlas-report.md).

To report an issue with this **Atlas GitHub repository** please:

 2. Open a [blank issue](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/issues/new).

**Disclaimer:** To formally notify an errata to the IPCC, users should follow the [IPCC errata notification procedure](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#errata).
